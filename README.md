# Need & Give

This repository gathers all documents, ux wireframes, mocks for Need &amp; Give project types.

During ideas brainstorming, we identified a general project type, which we called Need & Give.
The concrete implementations suggested were:

### [01 - Platform for exchanging used items](project-details/01 - Platform for exchanging used items.md)
People list and trade used goods for other used goods, no money involved.

### [02 - Platform for donating items](project-details/02 - Platform for donating items.md)
List institutions and items they need and people and items they can donate.
Can also involve monetary donations.

### [03 - Food meals listing and sharing](project-details/03 - Food meals listing and sharing.md)
People list meals in restaurants or at home they would like to share.

### [04 - Platform for social funding](project-details/04 - Platform for social funding.md)
List people in need of medical equipment and allow monetary contributions from people.

### [05 - Local communities items loan portal](project-details/05 - Local communities items loan portal.md)
List items (power tools, home appliances, etc.) people have for loaning and allow users to search for nearby items.



Let's refine these ideas more and see how many features/code building block they have in common.
Soon we should choose one of them to implement first, so we can start thinking of concrete user interaction details.
